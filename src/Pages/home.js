            <h3>Hello and Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
            <p>My name is <span>Roggero Spezialy</span> and this portfolio is made to help showcase the skills as well as the abilities I have learned while going through a coding bootcamp via SprinBoard or through self research on various platforms.</p>
            <p>While I did go through the Front-End Software Development course, my end goal is to create apps and video games. I love the idea of creating something that helps people in various of ways and a good way is through video games.</p>
